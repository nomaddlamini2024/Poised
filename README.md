## Project's Title

**Poised Project Management System (PMS)**

`MainMenu.java` is a Poised Project Management System (PMS) program, created for a small structural engineering firm, "Poised." This system will enable the firm to efficiently manage and keep track of their projects.

---

## Project Description

`MainMenu.java`, in collaboration with other Java files (`DatabaseConnectionManager.java`, `InputValidator.java`, `ProjectManager.java`), is a Java program that serves as a project management system.

The system helps the structural engineering firm Poised to:
- Manage ongoing and completed projects.
- Organize projects in the pipeline.

---

## What the Application Does

The `MainMenu.class` in the PoisePMS application system provides a menu-driven interface to manage projects and associated personnel in a database. It allows users to:
- Add new projects.
- Update existing projects.
- Delete projects and associated personnel data.
- Finalize projects by marking them as "finalized" and adding completion dates.
- View specific project details.
- Search for incomplete projects.
- Locate projects by entering the project number or name.

### Information Stored in the System
The following data is managed in the database:
- **Project Details**
  - Project number.
  - Project name.
  - Type of building being designed.
  - Physical address.
  - ERF number.
  - Total fee charged for the project.
  - Total amount paid to date.
  - Project deadline.
- **Personnel Information**
  - Architect's name, phone, email, and address.
  - Contractor's name, phone, email, and address.
  - Customer's name, phone, email, and address.

## Why the Project is Useful

- Users can easily capture and organize information about new and existing projects.
- Projects can be managed and updated seamlessly.
- The system simplifies tracking of incomplete or finalized projects.
- Provides a centralized database for storing all project-related details, ensuring efficient management.

## How Users Can Get Started with the Project

Follow these steps to run the **Poised Project Management System Java program** (`MainMenu.java`):

### Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Download and install the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the Oracle website or a trusted source.

### Step 2: Prepare the Java Files
- Copy and paste the following files into a code editor of your choice:
  - `MainMenu.java`
  - `DatabaseConnectionManager.java`
  - `InputValidator.java`
  - `ProjectManager.java`
- Save them with a `.java` extension in your desired location.

### Step 3: Open the Command Prompt/Terminal
- On Windows, open a command prompt (e.g., `C:\Users\joesoap>`).

### Step 4: Navigate to the Directory
- Use the `cd` command to move to the folder where the Java files are saved. Example:
  ```bash
  C:\Users\joesoap>cd desktop
  C:\Users\joesoap\Desktop>cd task8
  C:\Users\joesoap\Desktop\task8>
  ```

### Step 5: Compile the Code
- Compile `MainMenu.java` by typing:
  ```bash
  javac MainMenu.java
  ```
- This will generate a `.class` file in the same directory.

### Step 6: Run the Program
- Run the program by typing:
  ```bash
  java MainMenu
  ```
- The program will execute and display the output.
